## Complexity Budget

Default to the simplest implementation that passes the tests.
Before adding any abstraction, pattern, library, or layer — STOP and ask.
Complexity requires explicit approval. Simplicity never does.

If you are about to add a base class, an interface, a factory, a manager, a service layer,
or any indirection that isn't demanded by a failing test — stop. Ask first.


## Decision Gates

STOP and present options before implementing any of the following.
Do NOT implement. Present options and wait for approval.

- Architecture or structural decisions
- Library or framework selection
- Data model design
- Protocol choices
- Anything with physical consequences
- Any decision you are uncertain about


## When Presenting Options

Lead with your recommendation and one sentence why.
Then list alternatives with their tradeoff.

Format:
> I recommend X because Y.
> Alternatives: A (tradeoff), B (tradeoff).

Never present options without a recommendation.
Never present a recommendation without a reason.


## Anti-Bias Rules

| AI Bias | Correct Practice |
|---|---|
| Adds abstraction layers preemptively | YAGNI — build what the test requires, nothing more |
| Presents options without a recommendation | Always lead with recommendation + one sentence why |
| Chains implementation without stopping | Stop at every decision gate and wait for approval |
| Splits files prematurely | 200 line limit, but don't split until you hit it |
| Uses complex patterns to appear thorough | Simple code that passes tests is the goal, not impressive code |
| Makes assumptions when context is missing | Ask. Never assume. |
| Picks a library without presenting alternatives | Always a decision gate — stop and present options |

## Implementation Methodology

When presented with a request YOU MUST:

1. Use context7 mcp server or websearch tool to get the latest related documentation. Understand the API deeply and all of its nuances and options.
2. Use TDD: derive expected behavior first, write the failing test, then build until it passes.
3. Start with the simplest happy path test.
4. Think about what the assert should look like.
5. See the test fail.
6. Make the smallest change possible.
7. Check if test passes.
8. Repeat steps 6-7 until it passes.
9. YOU MUST NOT move on until assertions pass.


## Debugging Methodology

### Phase I: Information Gathering
1. Understand the error.
2. Read the relevant source code: try local `.venv`, `node_modules`, or `$HOME/.cargo/registry/src/`.
3. Look at any relevant GitHub issues for the library.

### Phase II: Testing Hypothesis
4. Develop a hypothesis that resolves the root cause. Must only chase root cause solutions. Think hard to decide if it's root cause or NOT.
5. Add debug logs to test hypothesis.
6. If not successful, YOU MUST clean up any artifacts or code attempts in this debug cycle. Then repeat steps 1-5.

### Phase III: Weigh Tradeoffs
7. If successful and fix is straightforward — apply fix.
8. If not straightforward — weigh tradeoffs and provide a recommendation using the options format above.


## Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never break up nested values.** When working with a value that is part of a larger structure, always import or pass the entire parent structure. Never extract or isolate the nested value from its parent context.
- **Get to the root of the problem.** Never write hacky workarounds.
- **Never create a file longer than 200 lines.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting into modules. Do not split prematurely.
- **Organize code into modules which can easily be added and removed** — grouped by architectural layer: controller/service for web, driver/client for embedded.
- **Strive for symmetry among all projects.** All projects, whatever the language, should follow the same patterns. The only exception is language idioms and idiosyncrasies.
- **Use `cfg.yml` for config variables. NEVER add config vars to env files.**
- **Use `template-secrets.env` to track the list of secrets.**
- **Use environment variables for secrets.** Do NOT conflate secrets with config variables.
- **Use dependency injection for testability.**
- **Keep class names generic:** `TimeseriesClient` not `TimescaleClient`.
- **Use generics judiciously.** If generics don't provide a clear benefit in code reuse, type safety, or API design — use concrete types instead.


## Testing & Reliability

When engaging in TDD:
1. Think about one useful happy path assert.
2. Write the failing test.
3. Write the function with `unimplemented!()` (Rust), `NotImplementedError` (Python), or `throw Error("Not Implemented")` (TypeScript).
4. See the not-implemented error.
5. Make the smallest change until it passes.

- **Use AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern for all tests.**
- **Unit tests colocated in `src/`.**
- **Integration tests in `tests/`.**
- **Use testcontainers for integration tests** — spin up real databases/services in Docker, session-scoped for performance.
- **Fail fast, fail early.** Detect errors as early as possible and halt. Rely on the runtime to handle the error and provide a stack trace. Do NOT write defensive error handling without a good reason.


## Style

- **Constants:** Top-level declarations in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Use explicit type hints always.** No `Any`.
- **Prefer Pydantic models over dicts for structured data.**
- **Use proper logging, not `print()` debugging.**


## Documentation
 - **Write comments in a terse and casual tone**
- **Comment non-obvious code.** Everything should be understandable to a mid-level developer.
- **Add an inline `# Reason:` comment** for complex logic — explain the why, not the what.
- **Write concise docstrings primarily for an LLM to consume**, secondarily for a document generator.


## AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask.**
- **Never hallucinate API or library functions.** Only use known, verified libraries.
- **Never chain steps through a decision gate.** Stop. Present options. Wait.
- **Never declare an API broken without research and confirmation.** If something doesn't work as expected, the first assumption is that you're using it wrong. Before concluding "bug": (1) search docs, forums, and GitHub issues, (2) read the library source, (3) write an isolated probe that eliminates your own usage errors. Only after all three confirm the behavior, label it a bug.


## TypeScript Language Guidelines 🌊

### Code Quality & Validation
- **Use `ts-pattern` instead of `switch`**

### Typescript Testing Guidelines
- **Use actual/expected semantics**  `assert.strictEqual(actual, expected)`
- 
### TypeScript Patterns
- **Prefer pattern matching:** Use ts-pattern library for structural matching
- **Prefer functional programming:** Use map/filter/reduce for transforming arrays
- **Use template literals** for string formatting
- **Use const assertions** for immutable data: `as const`
- **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants**

### Advanced Types
- **You MUST NOT** use loose types like `any`, `object`, `{}`, `Record<string, any>`, or `unknown` without justification.
- **You MUST ALWAYS** use specific interfaces, types, or branded types for data structures.
  - NOT: `function process(data: any): object`
  - NOT: `const config: Record<string, any> = {}`
  - NOT: `interface User { metadata: {} }`
  - CORRECT: `function process(data: UnprocessedData): ProcessedResult`
  - CORRECT: `const config: AppConfig = {}`
  - CORRECT: `interface User { metadata: UserMetadata }`
- The only acceptable use of `unknown` is when genuinely dealing with untrusted input that requires runtime validation before narrowing to a specific type.

- **Const enums for compile-time constants:**: 
   ```typescript
      const enum Status { PENDING, SUCCESS, ERROR }
   ```

- **Readonly and const assertions**: Use readonly and as const to make data immutable:
   ```typescript
   const config = {
     apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
     timeout: 5000,
   } as const;
   ```

- **Never type for exhaustive checking**: 

   ```typescript
   function assertNever(x: never): never {
     throw new Error("Unexpected object: " + x);
   }
   ```

- **Write concise JSDoc comments  for an llm to consume:**

  ```typescript
  export interface Stats {
   mean: number;
   median: number;
   stdDev: number;
   min: number;
   max: number;
   }

   /**
   * Calculates basic statistics (mean, median, std dev, min, max) for numeric data.
   * @param data Array of numbers to analyze
   * @returns Stats object with statistical metrics or throws on invalid input
   * @throws Error if array is empty or contains no valid numbers
   * @example calculateStats([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // {mean: 3, median: 3, stdDev: 1.58, min: 1, max: 5}
   */
   export function calculateStats(data: number[]): Stats {
   if (!data || data.length === 0) {
      throw new Error("Data array cannot be empty");
   }

   const valid = data.filter(x => isFinite(x));
   if (valid.length === 0) {
      throw new Error("No valid numbers found");
   }

   const mean = valid.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0) / valid.length;
   
   const sorted = [...valid].sort((a, b) => a - b);
   const median = sorted.length % 2 === 0
      ? (sorted[sorted.length / 2 - 1] + sorted[sorted.length / 2]) / 2
      : sorted[Math.floor(sorted.length / 2)];

   const variance = valid.reduce((sum, x) => sum + Math.pow(x - mean, 2), 0) / valid.length;
   const stdDev = Math.sqrt(variance);

   return {
      mean,
      median,
      stdDev,
      min: sorted[0],
      max: sorted[sorted.length - 1]
   };
  }
  ```


## NestJS Project Guidelines 😺

### Validation & Documentation
- **Use validation for all types** using the class-validator library
- **Document with OpenAPI decorators** - `@ApiTags()`, `@ApiOperation()`, `@ApiResponse()`

### Database & ORM
- **Use TypeORM for database access** with entity decorators
- **Use migrations** for database schema changes



### Testing Patterns
- **Use `.test.ts` suffix** instead of `.spec.ts` for test files
- **Use Bun for test execution:** Configure in package.json scripts
- **Test with NestJS Testing utilities:** `Test.createTestingModule()`
- **Use supertest for integration tests** in separate test files

### NestJS CLI Usage 🔧

#### Basic Module Generation
For simple module creation without controller unit tests:

```bash
# Generate complete module structure without controller unit tests. Controller tests skipped in favor of tetcontainers integration strategy. See below. 
nest g module foo && nest g controller foo --no-spec && nest g service foo
```

Creates:
- `foo/foo.module.ts` - Module definition with imports/exports
- `foo/foo.controller.ts` - Controller with basic endpoints
- `foo/foo.service.ts` - Service with business logic
- `foo/foo.service.spec.ts` - Service unit test only

#### Full Resource Generation
For complete CRUD resource with all components:

```bash
# Generate full resource with CRUD operations
nest g resource foo
```

When prompted:
- **Transport layer**: REST API
- **CRUD entry points**: Yes

Creates complete resource structure:
- `foo/foo.module.ts` - Module with controller and service
- `foo/foo.controller.ts` - Full CRUD controller (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- `foo/foo.service.ts` - CRUD service methods
- `foo/entities/foo.entity.ts` - TypeORM entity
- `foo/dto/create-foo.dto.ts` - Creation DTO
- `foo/dto/update-foo.dto.ts` - Update DTO
- `foo/foo.service.spec.ts` - Service unit tests


#### Integration Testing Strategy
- **Integration tests in `tests/` directory** with `.test.ts` suffix

## Integration Testing with Testcontainers 🐳

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install @testcontainers/postgresql --save-dev
npm install @types/supertest supertest --save-dev
```

### Best Practices
- **Shared container setup**: Use session-scoped containers for test efficiency
- **Database synchronization**: Enable `synchronize: true` for test databases
- **Module testing**: Test complete modules with dependency injection
- **SuperTest integration**: Use for HTTP endpoint testing with real requests
- **Repository testing**: Direct database entity testing for complex queries
- **Validation testing**: Ensure proper error handling for invalid inputs
